# Learning Javascript

__Learning Basic Syntax__

In order to learn the basic syntax of this language I tried to recreate
very basic code that I had already created in Ruby. This starts with the most
rudimentary execution of the classic 'Hello World' and then moved onto Fizzbuzz
and Mathematical equations.

In  order to reinforce my learning, I worked through the Code Academy course,
an Introduction to Javascript and reinforced this with starting the App Academy
Javascript cirriculum in order to move past the fundamentals.

Through these resources and some exercises I found online I created some mini
projects that have been uploaded to this repository-

- __Sleep Calculator__
  _Records sleep over a week and compares the total to the recommended amount
  for healthy sleep patterns._
- __Rock, Paper, Scissors__
  _A simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors between the user and computer_
- __Whale Language__
  _Similar to the 'pig latin' exercise I had made in Ruby. Involves loops,
  comparing arrays and changing words into new structures._

Some of the above mini projects involved learning from translation. As
aforementioned Whale Language was similar to Pig Latin in Ruby so I knew I had
to use arrays and be able to iterate through text to find particular letters.
I was able to explore if/else if/else statements from Rock, Paper, Scissors
and as I had already done such a task in Ruby I could see how I structured
that and then modify for the changes in syntax. I also was able to use loops
that were a familiar concept introduced in Ruby. However I quickly realised
that in Ruby there were many ways of looping through data structure
(.each, .inject, .map etc) compared to in JavaScript where the for and while
loops can be used in many different ways to the same effect.   

Learning by translation provided a useful framework for quickly ascertaining
what may be useful to learn in Javascript and how it may feature in more
complicated code and testing in the future.     



__Thermostat__

Thermostat introduced the concept of testing with Jasmine. It allowed for me to
understand the syntax required for testing and see how it compares to other
languages.

It also introduced JQuery. I had never worked with JQuery previous to this task.
I used the resource materials-
[link](https://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/) and an
introductory course from Code Academy that helped me understand Event Handlers
and Styling. I also wanted to be able to customize my project with animations
and this resource helped me work out how to do that.
